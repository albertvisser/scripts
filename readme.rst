My scripts
----------

A collection of simple (mostly bash) scripts I put together. Most of these are starters for applications that I put in /home/<user>/bin to have them on the system path.

`afrift`
    starts up my 'Find/Replace in Files' tool. This one requires no arguments.

`afrift_single`
    starts up the former's single file version. So one argument is required: the filename.

`a-propos`
    starts up my 'apropos' application. I had to rename it because there appeared to be a system tool by that name. No arguments.

`check-local`
    script to check if there are changes to local repositories that aren't synched into my central ones (the ones that push to BitBucket). No arguments.

`doctree`
    starts up my docs/notes organiser (QT version) from a standard location. No arguments.

`htmledit`
    starts up my tree-based html editor. Takes one argument: the filename.

`morefromdos.py`
    Python script to change Windows line endings to Unix ones for all Python files in a directory. Takes one argument: the directory name. Without an argument, works in the current working directory.

`permit.py`
    Python script to change file and directory permissions after copying over from Windows. Argument works like the previous one (except for all files instead of just .py ones). I wrote and used these scripts when I copied my old CGI apps over from Windows to Linux.

`probreg`
    starts up my 'probreg' application from a standard location. takes no arguments.

`sort_file.py`
    copy of a Python script I wrote on Windows to sort a (text) file from within Total Commander. Takes one argument: the file to sort.

`totalcmd`
    starts up Total Commander under Wine. takes no arguments.

`xmledit`
    starts up my tree-based xml editor. Takes one argument: the filename.
